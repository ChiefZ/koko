# About `ココ`

`ココ` is pronounced `koko`, which means `here` in Japanese.

`ココ` is an open source and free IRC client mainly for me and hopefully for others.

It provides minimalistic UI and some VIM-like shortcuts. It depends on the power of
HTML5, CSS and JavaScript through [Electron](http://electron.atom.io).

The logo is strongly inspired by
[Campfire](https://color.adobe.com/Campfire-color-theme-2528696/) color theme.


# Features

* Built on Electron
* Cross platform (currently only for OS X :apple:)
* VIM-like shortcuts
