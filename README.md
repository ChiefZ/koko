Yet another IRC client for me and you :koko:

# About `ココ`

`ココ` is a fully open sourced and completely free IRC client mainly
for me and possibly for others.

It provides simple UI and VIM-like interaction. Its UI depends on the power of
HTML5, CSS and JavaScript through [Electron](http://electron.atom.io),
so you can customise it as you want.

`ココ` is pronounced `koko`, which means `here` in Japanese.
The logo is strongly inspired by
[Campfire](https://color.adobe.com/Campfire-color-theme-2528696/) color theme.


# Features
